<p>
Dark is a tool for converting an MSI or MSM file into a WiX source file.  This tool is very useful for getting all your authoring into a WiX source file when you have an existing MSI or MSM.  However, you will then need to tweak this file to accomodate different languages and breaking things into fragments.
