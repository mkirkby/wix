  <h1>Dark</h1>

  <p>Dark is a tool for converting a Windows Installer database (.msi, .msm, .msp, .mst, .pcp) into a WiX source file. This tool is very useful for getting all your authoring into a WiX source file when you have an existing Windows Installer database. However, you will then need to tweak this file to accomodate different languages and breaking things into fragments.</p>
