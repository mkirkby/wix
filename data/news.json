Those fears are unfounded for three reasons. First, WiX v2 is stable so we are not expecting another build of that version unless a showstopper bug shows up. Second, weekly drops show up at the <a href='http://wix.sourceforge.net/releases'>Weekly Releases</a> release point regularly. Finally, pushing to the <a href='http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=105970'>SourceForge release point</a> is a manual process for us and ends up a lower priority. In any case, development is still very much active and the <a href='http://wix.sourceforge.net/mailinglists.html#wix-users'>wix-users mailing list</a> is still the best place to get your questions answered."
