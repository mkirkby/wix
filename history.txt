          enabled their use by adding UIRef/@Id="WixUI_ErrorProgressText"
          to your source.

BobArnso: - Use whole sentences for localization, instead of building up 
            sentences by using properties to specify different verbs and word 
            forms, as many languages don't easily follow English word order.
          - Add ActionText/Template loc strings

JRock: Making the wix20 public branch build correctly using NAnt and only
       the publicly available SDKs (not the dtools versions).

BobArnso: - Make Sconce and Votive optional, so the VSIP SDK isn't required to
            build the core toolset.

DerekC: Allow DocCompiler to correctly generate documentation for a deprecated
        element which does not specify a replacement element.

DerekC: Make the Component/@Guid attribute mandatory.

EdYoung: Change the compiler so that if a user specifies a multistring registry

         values to put in the value.

BobArnso: Added instructions in "Building WiX" .CHM topic on modifying

DerekC: SFBUG:1427916 - Fix poor RemoveFile error message.

BobArnso: - Add WixUI_InstallDir dialog set 
            (welcome > install dir > progress > finish)
          - Move dialog UI sequences out of WixUI_Common and into the dialogs
            themselves so custom sets can replace everything
          - Build a single wixui.wixlib instead of several separate .wixlibs
            (breaking change -- projects must now reference a particular
            WixUI set name)
          - Fix sfbug:1425869 (Controls extend beyond boundaries)

BobArnso: To reduce localization effort, refactor common text (e.g., "Next" 
          and "Cancel") to use global loc strings rather than dialog-specific 
          loc strings.

DerekC: Treat warnings as errors for all builds using wix tools.
        Also fix warnings related to recent changes.

AaronSte: Fix other instances of sfbug:1425869 (Controls extend beyond 
          boundaries)

BobArnso: Change zipping target to create a distribution tree

DerekC: Empty tables in a wixout are currently not allowed according to the
        schema, but they should work for cases like the usage of EnsureTable.

DerekC: Fix SF1445272: File attributes not propagated from merge modules

DerekC: Add the ability to retrieve Vista-only culture information on .net 2.0.

JNanneng: Properly modularize IIsAppPool.User_.

DerekC: Fix a bug with modularization of conditions in which there is an empty
        string literal ("").  Also make the decompiler round-trip the DrLocator

            Vista (verified with build 5342)
          - Corrected size of bitmaps to avoid resize distortion
          - Conditionalized VerifyReadyDlg controls to match ProgressDlg and 
            removed VerifyRemoveDlg and VerifyRepairDlg

SteveWo: Add -indent:<n> option to WiXCop to override default indentation
         multiple of 2

JRock: Integrated all of the Vs2005 test projects from wix to wix20.

JRock: Massive Votive rework and bug fixing. This brings Votive to the most
       stable release to date. Extensive testing was done on both Visual
       Studio 2003 and 2005. Also, some new features were added.
       - SFBUG:1457689 - Project does not build in VS 2005
       - SFBUG:1418194 - Unable to build UI installers with votive
       - SFBUG:1407291 - Errors when delete file from a WiX project
       - SFBUG:1402552 - space in RelativeOutputDirectory produces error
       - SFBUG:1374561 - Problems creating WiX Project in VS 2005
       - SFBUG:1357724 - votive preprocessor should replace "." in project names
       - SFBUG:1277228 - Rename causes assertion failure
       - SFBUG:1245805 - Error: Invalid pointer
       - SFBUG:1244159 - Rename files in Votive causes incorrect UI
       - SFBUG:1240565 - Adding a new file to Votive in VS 2005 Beta 2 fails
       - SFBUG:1237410 - Another project is already building. Please cancel that
                         build
       - SFBUG:1234899 - Error dialog displayed when selecting a file
       - SFBUG:1232582 - Directory support in votive projects
       - SFBUG:1212472 - Incremental building
       - SFBUG:1183029 - Project Build/Rebuild not implemented
       - SFBUG:1176499 - double clicking on the file gives error
       - SFBUG:1124165 - "The parameter is incorrect"
       - Feature       - Added an optional RelativeIntermediateDirectory
                         attribute to the <Configuration> section of the wixproj
                         file. This allows for a directory to put the .wixobj
                         files so they aren't in the same directory as the
                         project output. Existing .wixproj files are still valid
                         without this attribute.
       - Feature       - Added support for the -loc flag for light.exe. All of
                         the .wxl files in the project will be used in the link
                         phase.
       - Feature       - Incremental build now works!! Also, the Clean, Build,
                         and Rebuild menu items work for WiX projects in both
                         VS 2003 and VS 2005. Interesting note, VS 2005 changed
                         the way it builds projects by adding support for
                         querying for project up-to-date status. In my
                         implementation of the interface, I was returning S_OK,
                         which indicates that the project is up-to-date and
                         doesn't need to be rebuilt. Consequently, VS never
                         called into me to build. It turns out that I have to
                         actually return E_FAIL to indicate that the project is
                         out of date. How in the heck am I supposed to know
                         that!! It's not documented anywhere. I only found out
                         by looking at the CPP hierarchy project that ships with
                         the SDK. Go figure.

DerekC: Use the proper file names for *.exe.config files in Votive setup.

BobArnso: Add -NXCOMPAT, -SafeSEH, and -hotpatch switches for all C++ projects

JRock: - SFBUG:1350404 - Deleting Wix Reference deletes the underlining Wixlib file
       - SFBUG:1237769 - References in votive

JRock: - SFBUG:1244659 - Assertion Failed: The collection is read-only
       - SFBUG:1221801 - If project does not load, context menu is wrong.

RobMcInt: Add Print functionality to the license dialogs.

Chilbert: Fix a bug where formatted registry keys caused a failure in the
          SecureObject custom action.  Couldn't set permissions on the
          registry key.  Just needed to format the data that is pulled from
          the Registry table.  Also fixed aclutil.cpp so that CREATOR OWNER
          common sid actually sets up the appropriate ACL

BobArnso: Deliver PDB and source .zips as well as binaries

BobArnso: Fix ICE validation in Votive.msi and WixUI qtests

JRock: Added property page support for WiX projects! Only one page is
       implemented right now. More to come. It only works in VS 2005,
       however. This is probably the start of a VS 2003/2005 separation. I've
       been running into too many little discrepancies that is really draining
       my time and it's getting too cumbersome to support two different versions
       of Visual Studio simultaneously since testing has to be done twice. The
       code base between the two versions is still identical, however, and will
       probably continue to be so as long as its feasible.

RobMen: Fix race condition when multiple processes build cabinets at the same
        time.

DerekC: Convert all WiX xml files to 4-space indentation.

BobArnso: Change zipping to zip explicit file extensions rather than whole
          trees. That lets us build WiX using WiX.sln (which puts the binaries
          relative to the source) without cluttering up the sources .zip file.

DerekC: SFBUG:1476404 - Exception with -ust option

BobArnso: Don't include .cub files in the sources .zip file

BobArnso: Fix WixUI loc bugs by resizing various text fields: 
          SFBUG:1469187, SFBUG:1469191, SFBUG:1469194

BobArnso: Skip strong-name-verification-skipping if the pubic-key token is
          already listed (so once it's listed, the build runs as a normal,
          limited user rather than requiring admin rights).

DerekC: SFBUG:1477225 - Duplicate symbol found when using wixui and wixca
        libraries

DerekC: Merging fixes:
        - SFBUG1446323 - Conflict using MSMs and Suppress Sequence Tables
        - Suppression of an individual action from an already suppressed table
          results in an uncaught exception.

BobArnso: Updated WiX.chm with recent WixUI changes

BobArnso: Simplified binaries.zip layout to flatten the ca and ui trees

        SKIPCONFIGUREIIS property
        - Add RegSearch for IIS version

DerekC: SFBUG:1487663 - Missing MergeRef causes ApplicationException

DerekC: The ListView.Value and ListView.Text columns should be formatted.

DerekC: SFBUG:1122555 - Support localization of control sizes and positions

ScotK,AviPi: Use short paths for PerfMon to avoid localization issues with long
             paths.

BobArnso: - Change WixUI_InstallDir to support path-setting directly in 
            InstallDirDlg (without needing to click Change) [Note that this 
            change impacts loc strings]
          - Swap OK and Cancel button locations in BrowseDlg
          - Add a PropertyRef so error occurs if you use WixUI_InstallDir 
            without setting WIXUI_INSTALLDIR property

DerekC: Fix qtests so they will stop looking for files in the WiX 3.0 branch.

a-TsunH: Updated ProgressDlg.wxs to display title and text in minor upgrade.

        contains that functionality.

BobArnso: Add support for Windows 2003 R2 Platform SDK

FreGro: SFBUG:1438209 - Infinite loop in ConfigureComPlusUninstall
        SFBUG:1420636 - Null pointer reference in com+ custom action
        MSMQ CustomActions now always grants the local Administrators group
                        all permisions for a newly created queue.

DerekC: - Prevent an exception from being thrown for merge modules without an
          embedded cabinet.
        - Allow SqlScript/@BinaryKey to ommitted (to support a Binary child
          element).  This authoring is actually disallowed in WiX 3.0 - but we
          need to keep supporting it in 2.0 because some groups may be running
          the compiler with schema suppression enabled (so this authoring works
          for them, even though its unsupported by the schema).

DerekC: SFBUG:1511706 - ODBCDriver fails in merge modules

BobArnso: Add SDK subdirectory to binaries .zip to include MsgGen and
          DocCompiler so you can build extensions without WiX sources.
          Headers and libraries live there too.

RobMen: Add verbose message for when cabinets are streamed into MSI.

DerekC: Parse Property/@Id as an identifier.

DerekC: SFBUG:1519658 - MsiDriverPackages validation data is wrong

JohnLS: Fixed bug in NativeImage custom action when there are no GAC'd 
        assemblies.

DerekC: More strictly parse some Shortcut attribute values.

BobArnso: Added extension .XSDs to binaries .zip

DerekC: Allow SqlString to support arbitrarily long SQL queries.

DerekC: Parse more attributes as identifiers where appropriate.

DerekC: Correct several incorrect forms of the null guid which may break merge
        modules from properly resolving feature links when merged.

DerekC: Add support for later MSI 4.0 features.

DerekC: - SFBUG:1539986 - Merge module row generation bug
        - Enforce ModuleSignature.ModuleID as an identifier value

DerekC: Don't modularize the NetFxExecuteNativeImageCommit custom action.

DerekC: SFBUG:1543994 - candle -ust fails for Shortcut

DerekC: SFBUG:1544057 - Patchgroup attribute causes installation to fail

BobArnso: Fix bug in WixUI_InstallDir so that SetTargetPath is called, 
          updating child directories of WIXUI_INSTALLDIR. (Without it,
          only the one directory is updated; children retain the original
          structure as defined by the Directory table.)

DerekC: SFBUG:1548526 - Column/@Category="Template" changes to "Formatted"

LeeTh: Fixed bug in SchedServiceConfig where we were writing rollback CA data
       into the CA data buffer, causing the first service instaled to be 
       misconfigured and any subsequent services to cause an install failure.

RobMen: SFBUG:1510473 - fix invalid strings in Dutch .wxl file

RobMen: SFBUG:1496774 - remove uk-ua .wxl that isn't ready

        Uninstall ignores failures.  Made order of NativeImage CAs sequential.
        Fixed trasposed flag (NoDependencies and Profile)

RobMen: Actually include hu-hu .wxl file in .zip file.

RobMen: Implement MsiPatchCertificates and MsiDigitalCertificate table.

AaronSte: Add a bunch of Visual Studio detection properties and custom actions
          to VSExtension.
