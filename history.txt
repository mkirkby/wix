BobArnso: Add and enable WixUICostingPopupOptOut WiX variable to turn off the
          modal dialog shown when MSI hasn't yet completed costing. There is an
          intermittent bug that prevents it from setting the CostingComplete 
          property so the modal dialog is shown forever. This setting is 
          enabled by default for now to verify the problem can be worked around 
          by not checking for CostingComplete. If successful, it will become an
          opt-in behavior. For now, to return to the previous behavior, add
              <WixVariable Id="WixUICostingPopupOptOut" Value="0" />
