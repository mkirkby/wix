        encapsulate management of groups and ordering information. Switched
        old UX/Payload(Group) flattening in Linker to use the new
        WixGroupingOrdering class, and added inferred ordering to UX/Payload/

          component id when generating the hashed short filename. NOTE THAT 
          THIS IS A POTENTIALLY BREAKING CHANGE FOR PATCH GENERATION. 
          Components without @Id attribute values and with files whose names 
          aren't valid 8.3 short filenames now generate different short 
          filenames. See http://www.joyofsetup.com/2010/03/20/serial-monogamy-with-your-development-tools/
          for more information.

JaredR: Add "@DownloadUrl" to Chain packages and Payloads, with Binder support
        for the burn engine's package/payload @Packaging attribute.
        Refactored Chain packages to use Payload rows to track the package
        files, rather than duplicating the columns in ChainPackages.

BriaRo: Stopped the defaulting to 1 thread for cabbing and allowed for -ct to be
        used as designed.

          VS 2010 Express Edition for Windows Phone. Added some detail to the docs
          for RegistrySearch.

          installs.

BobArnso: Set the default Package/@InstallerVersion attribute value to 200 for 
          64-bit packages, as Windows Installer 2.0 was the first version to 
          support them.

BobArnso: Skip pedantic error for ambiguous keypaths when using component 
          authoring compatible with generated component GUIDs.

        payloads.

JaredR: Added UX Manifest support: optional 'uxManifest' attribute for table
        definitions, additional extension points for packages, and Binder code
        to generate a 'UxManifest.xml' file and include it in the UX data.
        Updated DocCompiler to include 'any' element and 'anyAttribute'
        documentation annotations in the generated docs.

          http://www.joyofsetup.com/2010/03/27/wix-msbuild-v2-0-and-x64-systems/.

RobMen: SFBUG:2837367 - verify database names do not go over 128 characters.

RobMen: SFBUG:2994398 - support spaces in build path.

RobMen: SFBUG:2896938 - CustomAction/@Id is required, ensure it is.

         deferred custom action.

MiCarls: SFBug:2971082 - Fix bad formatting when printing Eula
         SFBug:2932076 - Make util:User custom action more robust

WixBuild: Version 3.5.1630.0

RobMen: Move build to NAnt 0.9 Beta 1.

BobArnso: Update Lux test generator to consider all source files that are 
          fragments, not just those with unit tests. This allows you to isolate
          your unit-test authoring in its own file and share other authoring
          between unit-test projects and functional-test projects or other
          "real" installers.

WixBuild: Version 3.5.1710.0

MikeHo: Add Disallow to MajorUpgrade to prevent upgrades

BobArnso: Add and enable WixUICostingPopupOptOut WiX variable to turn off the
          modal dialog shown when MSI hasn't yet completed costing. There is an
          intermittent bug that prevents it from setting the CostingComplete 
          property so the modal dialog is shown forever. This setting is 
          enabled by default for now to verify the problem can be worked around 
          by not checking for CostingComplete. If successful, it will become an
          opt-in behavior. For now, to return to the previous behavior, add
              <WixVariable Id="WixUICostingPopupOptOut" Value="0" />
          to your authoring.
